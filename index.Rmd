I've applied for resource allocation at Swedish NAtional Infrastucture for Computing (SNIC) and I'm waiting for the SNIC proposal to go through so I can get my gene-ontology (GO) protein classification for lifeAndDeath project in SNIC with multicore processing. Using my 8 local cores, It would theoretically take 10 days to get the GO protein classifications.

Setting up a Rmarkdown log for this project.
