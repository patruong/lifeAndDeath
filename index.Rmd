### 12:02 - curl on Uniprot.

I might be able to speed up the collection, by using bash curl and multiprocessing to to collect data from uniprot GO. This should be much quicker than python requests.

This means I will have to learn:
- multiprocessing on bash.
- curl to get uniprot info.

I've applied for resource allocation at Swedish NAtional Infrastucture for Computing (SNIC) and I'm waiting for the SNIC proposal to go through so I can get my gene-ontology (GO) protein classification for lifeAndDeath project in SNIC with multicore processing. Using my 8 local cores, It would theoretically take 10 days to get the GO protein classifications.

Setting up a Rmarkdown log for this project.
