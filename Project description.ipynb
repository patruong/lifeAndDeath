    "In lights of the success of the ProTargetMiner study (Saei et al. - ProTargetMiner as a proteome signature library of anticancer molecules for functional discovery) further data mining from the same data set, but extended with the proteome of dying cells will be conducted in this project. The overall goal of this project is to analyze the proteome for living and dying cells to understand cell death, specifically to find proteome signatures relating to cell death regardless of which treatment or cell line the cells belongs to, as well as be able to identify different apoptotic processes in the cell. The dataset consists of living and dead cells of three cell lines (cancer cell lines; A549, RKO and MCF-7). The apoptotic process has been introduced by nine different cancer treatments (8-zaguanine, Raltitrexed, Topotecan, Floxuridine, Nutlin, Dasatinib, Gefitinib, Vincristine and Bortezomib), and there are three replicates, meaning that in total there are 60 different conditions in 3 replicates.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project there is a couple of things we would like to investigate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The number of apoptotic pathways. It has been suggested that there are at least two major signalling pathways trigger apoptotic cell death in [Geen et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4665079/), but we would like to investigate exactly how many there are. \n",
    "2) Proteome signature for surviving and dying cells regardless of treatment or cell line. To do this we would need to investigate target regulation in dying vs. surviving cells for each treatment and cell line as well.   \n",

    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The apoptotic process is related to many human diseases, which may result when cells die that shouldn't and other live that should die. Modulation of apoptotic processes may therefore offer valuable methods of treatment ([Renehan et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1120576/)). Understanding the apoptotic process is therefore very important. A dataset used in [Saei et al.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13582-8) proved to be of valuable for uncovering protein signatures relating to drug compound targets and actions mechnisms. Therefore an extension of this dataset with the proteome of the dead cell states gives hopes in uncovering information about the apoptotic process. \n"

    "### The importance of apoptosis for medicin\n",
    "Apoptosis is the the mechanism of controlled cell death. It has a complementary, but opposite role to mitosis (cell division) in the regulation of cell populations [Kett et al. 1972](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2008650/). The importance of understanding has wide interest in the biomedical research community because of its linkage to many biological processes ([Renehan et al. 2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1120576/)); ranging form celllular homeostatsis and tumorigenesis ([Renehan et al. 2001](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11264570/)), teratogenesis ([Norimura et al 1996](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8616719/)), pathogenesis ([Thompson C.B.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7878464/)), cancerogenesis ([Wyllie et al. 1999](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10466759/), [O'Connell et al. 1999](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10086376/)) as well as its importance to developing therapeutic agens [Nicholson D.W.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11048733/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of dying and suriving cells\n",
    "The hypothesis that dead cells contains valuable information has previously been proven in [Saei et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29572246/). In [Chernobrovkin et al. 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26052917/) it was shown that the abundance change in late apoptosis is exceptional compared to the expectations based on the abundances of co-regulated proteins, which further supports the fact that dead cells contain valuable information. Also, in [Chernobrovkin et al. 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/cddiscovery201668) it is found that the regulation patterns of the 200-500 most abundant proteins typically attributed to household type proteins (proteins that are needed by every cell type and that are highly abundant[Geiger et al. 2012](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3316730/)) more accurately reflect that of the proteins directly interacting with the drug than any other protein subset grouped by common function or biological process, including cell death. The fact that proteomics display information about the death mechanics tells us that proteomics can be used for the assessment of death modalities [Chernobrovkin et al. 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/cddiscovery201668)."
