Starting up a .md log instead of .rmd log.

So, all the proteins in a sample get a TMT-tag. The MS1 scan contains multiplexed peaks, performing DDA on a peak gives us a MS2 with TMT-tag peaks. Since the TMT-tag have different mass they will tell us the quantity of the peptides for each sample. The MS2 peaks are the same for each sample.
